"# Heat-transfer-finite-difference-"   

Solve Laplace equation via gauss seidel aka Liebmann method on a square with given boundaries.  

To Do:  
* ~~writing the initial conditions on the screen~~  and drawing heat map  
* Getting rid of the nested loop by using numpy  
* Finding better collor map for heat transfer  
* Documentation and commenting  
* Changing for arbitrary shapes and boundaries  
* Compare with other methods including FFT (as benchmark)  
* Find out whether matrix_temp = np.copy(initial_matrix) improves the code   
* In 3D? with camera rotation...maybe?
